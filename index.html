      <p>
        I picked up <strong class="names">Bagheera</strong> and
        <strong class="names">Leo</strong> from a pet store while I was living
        in Deerfield Beach, FL in 2016. I had moved there the year before and
        was ready to have some companions. They were both 4 months old when I
        got them and now they are already 6! Time really does fly.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong class="names">Mowgli</strong> has quite a different story. I
        recently moved back to Atlanta, GA and was out running errands before
        leaving for a vacation a days later. As I was driving all of the sudden
        I saw this black thing in the middle of the road that everyone was
        swerving around. That is when I realized it was a baby kitten. No one
        else was stopping and I realized there was no way I could go the rest of
        my day not knowing if it survived or not. So I pulled over into the next
        parking lot, jumped out of my car and ran out into the road to grab it.
        Next thing I know he has stolen my heart and I realize I have to keep
        him after saving his life. He went through a few name changes before I
        finally settled on Mowgli.

        <h3>Bagheera</h3>
        <p>
          He is VERY snuggly and follows me around where ever I go. He hates
          when I leave the house to do anything, and sleeps with me every night
          on my pillow. His favorite toys are my hair ties and a small stick
          from outside ðŸ˜‚. He hates when the food bowl is empty and doesn't
          hesitate to let me know.

        <h3>Leo</h3>
        <p>
          Leo is also very snuggly and shy, but also very talkative. He LOVES to
          play and would play all day long if I had the time to entertain him
          that long. His favorite toys are Mardi Gras beads, shoe strings, the
          lazor pointer, and toy mouses. Basically any toy that makes a sound he
          loves it. He also loves to rip paper so if there is a paper towel left
          behind, it will be shreaded to bits.

      <section class="mowgli" id="mowgli">
        <h3>Mowgli</h3>
        <p>
          Mowgli is my fiesty one! He only snuggles when he thinks I don't
          notice. He is independent and LOVES to be outside. He will spend all
          day out on the patio if I let him. Which can be brutal in the summer
          and winter months, but I know it makes him happy. He loves watching
          the birds, squirrals, and leaves that blow in the wind. He loves to
          play fetch with his mouse toy and he plays soccer with his toy balls.
          I believe he is a bit of a dog at heart and was a soccer player in a
          past life.
